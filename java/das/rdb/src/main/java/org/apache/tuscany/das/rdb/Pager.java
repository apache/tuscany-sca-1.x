/**
 * An iterator-like interface to conveniently move through chunks of data. The
 * idea is that a Pager works with a read Command. The read command returns a
 * large amount of data and the client wants to work with chunks of it at a
 * time. So the Pager is created on the command and each call to next returns
 * the next chunk of data. This is done completely disconnected. No cursor is
 * maintained between calls to #next.
 * 
 * TODO - This is very preliminary. We need to look at this interface in the
 * context of disonnected scenarios such as a web app. The Pager instance will
 * probably be saved in session so it must be very light and cannot reference a
 * connection. Also, we probably need to define a factory or add a method to set
 * page size.
