Apache Tuscany SCA Travel Sample 1.0 May 2010 Release Notes
===========================================================

The Apache Tuscany SCA Travel Sample shows how Apache Tuscany SCA
can be used in a business application.

Overview
--------

The travel sample consists of a number of scenarios which demonstrate
various aspects of SCA and Apache Tuscany in the context of a travel
booking application. Details of these scenarios can be found in the
travel sample README file.

Unlike other Apache Tuscany SCA samples that are included in the
Apache Tuscany SCA distribution, the travel sample is released as a
separate package. This matches how user applications are developed
and makes it easier for Apache Tuscany users to use the travel sample
as a template for developing and packaging their own applications.

The travel sample distribution contains source code and build files for
the travel sample, together with binary dependencies of the travel sample
that aren't included in the Apache Tuscany SCA Java binary distribution.
The distribution doesn't include binaries for the travel sample because
one of the major purposes of this sample is to show users how to build
and run an Apache Tuscany application from source code. See the BUILDING
and README files for details of the steps needed to do this.

See the travel sample CHANGES file for a detailed list of new features
and bug fixes in this release.
