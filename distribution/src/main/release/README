README for the Apache Tuscany SCA Travel Sample 1.0 May 2010
============================================================

Structure of the travel sample
------------------------------

The travel sample consists of the following directory tree:

lib              dependencies for the travel sample (see notes below) 
  jaxws          jars from the JAX-WS reference implementation
  junit          the Junit jar
  openejb        jars from the OpenEJB binary distribution
travelsample     top-level directory for the travel sample
  binaries       builds a binaries-only package for the travel sample
  clients        non-SCA clients for the travel sample
  contributions  SCA contributions for the travel sample
  distribution   builds the travel sample distribution
  domainconfig   configuration files for the domain manager
  launchers      launcher programs for the travel sample
  services       non-SCA services used by the travel sample
  testdomain     scratch directory for trying out the domain manager
  util           utility code used by other parts of the travel sample

Note 1: The travel sample depends on the Apache Tuscany SCA Java 1.x binary
distribution, which is downloaded separately from the travel sample.
To avoid needless duplication, the "lib" directory of the travel sample
only contains dependencies that aren't provided in the current release
of the Tuscany SCA Java 1.x binary distribution.

Note 2: Before attempting to build or run the travel sample, you will need to
download the Apache Tuscany SCA Java 1.6 (or later) binary distribution and
set your TUSCANY_HOME environment variable to a local directory containing
the unpacked binary distribution. 


Overview of the travel sample
-----------------------------

The travel sample consists of a number of related scenarios. For each
scenario, this section lists the following:
 Description: A description of the scenario.
 Contributions: SCA contributions used in the scenario. Each contribution
   is a subdirectory of the travelsample/contributions directory.
 Launchers: Launchers used in the scenario. Each launcher is a subdirectory
   of the travelsample/launchers directory.
 Services: Non-SCA services used in the scenario, if any. Each non-SCA 
   service is a subdirectory of the travelsample/services directory.
 Clients: Non-SCA clients used in the scenario, if any. Each non-SCA
   client is a subdirectory of the travelsample/clients directory.
 Webapp: Web application (.war) file used to run the scenario, for those
   scenarios that use contributions packaged as web applications and
   deployed in a Web application server such as Tomcat.

Details of how to build and run these scenarios can be found in later
sections of this file.

1) Jumpstart - First simple example of using Tuscany 

Description: The jumpstart launcher shows the code needed to load an
 SCA contribution and invoke a method. The introducing-trips contribution
 shows how to package an SCA component in a contribution.
Contributions: introducing-trips
Launchers: jumpstart

2) Introducing - Simplified introduction to the travel application

Description: This scenario introduces a simplified form of the travel
 booking application that will be developed and extended by other
 scenarios in the travel sample. This scenario gives a clearer picture
 than jumpstart of how SCA applications are constructed because it
 shows multiple SCA components connected together with references wired
 to services.
Contributions: introducing-client, introducing-tours, introducing-trips
Launchers: introducing

3) Introducing (distributed) - Distributed services with a domain manager

Description: We're using the same SCA components, services, and implementations
 as in the previous scenario but with a big difference--they're distributed
 across multiple execution nodes and they make remote calls to each other
 using configuration information provided by the Tuscany domain manager.
 For simplicity these nodes are represented as different processes running on
 a single computer, though the domain manager configuration could easily be
 modified to run the nodes on different computers communicating across a network.
Contributions: introducing-client, introducing-tours, introducing-trips
Launchers: introducing-client, introducing-domain, introducing-tours,
 introducing-trips

4) Using SCA - Defining and using SCA Components

Description: The examples in this scenario show how to define SCA components
 and how to use SCA components in a business application.  This "guided tour"
 consists of code samples illustrating the major features of SCA components
 including implementations, services, interfaces, references, wires, properties,
 bindings and domains.
Contributions: usingsca
Launchers: usingsca

5) Building blocks - Using SCA composites as application building blocks

Description: We're looking at how to create composite applications using
 SCA composites as building blocks. The ToursImpl composite shows how to
 use a composite as a component implementation (black box reuse) and the
 ToursImplInclude composite demonstrates including one composite in another
 (white box reuse). The ToursAppl composite combines both of these kinds
 of reuse and shows how easy it is to build a full composite application
 using building blocks.
Contributions: buildingblocks, buildingblocks-client, introducing-trips
Launchers: buildingblocks

6) Interaction - Different SCA interaction styles

Description: Each SCA interaction pattern is demonstrated using a component
 from the travel booking application. We’re going to see the Hotel, Calendar,
 CurrencyConverter and ShoppingCart components used here. These components
 don't work in isolation so for each interaction pattern we've written a
 simple client component. For example, the InteractionLocalClient component
 demonstrates local interactions by sending a local message to the Calendar
 component. The launcher starts two nodes (node1 and node2) which are used
 to run samples for all of the interaction patterns. The first node "node1"
 loads the contributions common, currency, calendar, shoppingcart, and
 interaction-client, and runs the client.composite from the interaction-client
 contribution. The local interaction patterns are demonstrated by clients
 calling the currency, calendar, and shoppingcart components locally within
 node1. The second node node2 loads the contributions common, hotel, and
 interaction-service-remote, and runs the service.composite from the
 interaction-service-remote contribution. This node provides the hotel
 component that's used by client components in node1 for sending remote
 messages to demonstrate the remote interaction pattern.
Contributions: calendar, common, currency, flight, hotel, interaction-client, 
 interaction-service-remote, shoppingcart
Launchers: interaction

7) Full application - The full interactive travel application

Description: This is the fully functional travel application with a user
 interface for booking a trip (either pre-packaged or customized), adding the
 trip to a shopping cart, and checking out the purchase using a credit card.
Contributions: car, common, creditcard-payment-jaxb-policy, currency, flight,
 fullapp-bespoketrip, fullapp-coordination, fullapp-currency, fullapp-packagedtrip,
 fullapp-shoppingcart, fullapp-ui, hotel, payment-spring-policy, scatours,
 shoppingcart, travelcatalog, trip, tripbooking
Launchers: fullapp

8) Full application (distributed) - Distributed services with a domain manager

Description: This version of the full travel application uses multiple execution
 nodes and the domain manager. The execution nodes all run within the same
 process, which isn't very realistic but shows the flexibility of the Tuscany
 runtime model which allows nodes to be allocated to processes and computers in
 any combination. There's one small difference in the contributions used by this
 distributed version: payment-java-policy is used instead of payment-spring-policy
 because of an incompatibility between the domain manager and implementation.spring
 (see issue TUSCANY-3476).

Contributions: car, common, creditcard-payment-jaxb-policy, currency, flight,
 fullapp-bespoketrip, fullapp-coordination, fullapp-currency, fullapp-packagedtrip,
 fullapp-shoppingcart, fullapp-ui, hotel, payment-java-policy, scatours,
 shoppingcart, travelcatalog, trip, tripbooking
Launchers: fullapp-domain, fullapp-nodes

9) Callback

Description: SCA callbacks are illustrated using a variation of the Payment
 service which makes callbacks to the client to perform additional security
 checks for large payments.
Contributions: payment-java-callback 
Launchers: payment-java-callback

10) Reference passing

Description: We use another variation on the Payment service to show how
 SCA service references can be passed as parameters when invoking a service.
 The Payment service creates a service reference for the EmailGateway service
 and passes this service reference to the CreditCardPayment service.  When the
 CreditCardPayment service has finished doing the credit card authorization,
 it invokes the EmailGateway service using the service reference that was
 passed in.
Contributions: payment-java-reference-pass 
Launchers: payment-java-reference-pass

11) Help pages

Description: This scenario shows how an SCA application can expose HTML web pages
 by using an SCA component with the implementation.resource implementation type.
Contributions: help-pages
Launchers: help-pages

12) Blog feed

Description: An SCA component implementation of a blog is exposed as a
 feed via the Atom protocol using binding.atom and via the RSS protocol
 using binding.rss.  For each protocol there are example implementations
 using two different approaches: the getAll() method and the Collection API.
Contributions: blog-feed
Launchers: blog-feed

13) Feed logger

Description: An SCA component implementation is connected to an Atom feed
 using binding.atom and an RSS feed using binding.rss.  The SCA component
 receives and logs entries from both feeds.
Contributions: feed-logger
Launchers: feed-logger

14) Data binding

Description: A Payment component that uses JAXB as its data representation
 invokes a CreditCardPayment component that uses SDO to represent its data.
 The Tuscany data binding framework converts automatically between these
 different data representations.
Contributions: creditcard-payment-sdo, databinding-client, payment-java
Launchers: databinding

15) Policy

Description: The implementation of the Trip component has the tuscany:logging
 implementation policy applied to it which means that all invocations of all
 its services go through the JDKLoggingPolicyInterceptor class.  In addition
 the CreditCardPayment service has the "authentication" interaction policy
 intent which requires invocations of this service from the Payment component
 to use a policy set that satisifies this intent by providing authentication
 of the invoking client.
Contributions: creditcard-payment-jaxb-policy, payment-java-policy,
 policy-client, trip-policy
Launchers: policy

16) SCA credit card payment service packaged as a web application

Description: The CreditCardPayment service is packaged in a web application
 (.war file) including all its Tuscany runtime dependencies and suitable
 for deployment to a Web application server such as Apache Tomcat. The
 service is configured with a <binding.ws> endpoint which is exposed by
 Apache Tomcat and will display its WSDL in response to a ?wsdl request.
 The web application also includes a JSP which provides a user interface
 for invoking the CreditCardPayment service.
Contributions: creditcard-payment-jaxb, creditcard-payment-webapp
Webapp: creditcard-payment-webapp

17) Payment service with different implementation types

Description: In SCA the technology used to implement a service is encapsulated
 by the service and doesn't affect other components that invoke the service.
 In this scenario we show how the Payment service can be implemented using a
 range of different technologies while providing the same interface and the
 same semantics.

17a) implementation.bpel

Description: The Payment service is implemented using a BPEL process.
Contributions: creditcard-payment-jaxb, emailgateway, payment-bpel, payment-bpel-process

Description: The Payment service is implemented using a Spring application
 context which doesn't use any SCA-specific features.
Contributions: creditcard-payment-jaxb, payment-spring
Launchers: payment-spring

17g) implementation.spring with SCA tags

Description: The Payment service is implemented using a Spring application
 context which uses SCA-specific XML elements (tags) to define SCA references
 and properties.
Contributions: creditcard-payment-jaxb, payment-spring-scatag
Launchers: payment-spring-scatag

18) SCA currency converter service interoperating with SCA or non-SCA client

Description: In SCA a service can be configured with a variety of bindings
 to expose it using a range of different communication protocols. This
 scenario contains a number of examples showing the CurrencyConverter service
 exposed using different bindings and invoked by SCA or non-SCA clients 
 using various protocols.

Building the travel sample
--------------------------

Please see the BUILDING file in the travel sample distribution for full
details of how to build the travel sample using Maven or Ant.


Running travel sample scenarios from launcher source directories
----------------------------------------------------------------

After building the travel sample using either Maven or Ant, you can run
all the scenarios that have launchers by using ant scripts in the
subdirectories of the travelsample/launchers directory. For scenarios
that are packaged as web applications and don't have launchers, the next
section describes how you can run these.

You can run the launcher ant scripts as follows:
 1. Open a command prompt. 
 2. Change directory to travelsample/launchers/<launcher-dir> where
    <launcher-dir> is the launcher directory for the scenario that you
    want to run.
 3. Enter the command shown in Table 1 below. This command is usually
    "ant run". This runs an ant script that sets the necessary
    classpath and invokes the launcher class.
 4. Some scenarios require the above steps to be repeated multiple times
    with different commands. These cases are indicated by entries in
    Table 1 with more than one command listed. For these scenarios, all
    the listed commands should be entered in separate command prompts
    from the same current directory and in the same order as shown.
 5. Some scenarios have a browser-based user interface which is displayed
    by entering the URLs shown in Table 1 in a browser after running the
    launcher or launchers for the scenario. The recommended browser is
    Firefox as some scenarios don't work with Internet Explorer.

Running travel sample scenarios in a Web application server
-----------------------------------------------------------

Some scenarios are packaged as web applications (.war files) and don't
have launchers. After building the travel sample using either Maven or Ant,
you can use a Web application server to run these scenarios.

You can run these web applications as follows:
 1. Deploy the web application (.war) file to a Web application server
    such as Tomcat. The .war file can be found in the directory
    travelsample/contributions/<contrib-dir>/target where <contrib-dir>
    is the contribution directory listed in Table 2 below. The name of
    the .war file is scatours-contribution-<contrib-dir>.war.
 2. Display the browser-based user interface for the scenario by entering
    its URLs in a browser. The URLs for each scenario are shown in Table 2.
    The host and port in these URLs may need to be changed depending on the
    configuration of the Web application server in which the web application
    is deployed. These scenarios work in both Firefox and Internet Explorer.

Running the domain manager
--------------------------

The travelsample/testdomain directory is provided for the purpose
of running the domain manager and creating your own configuration.
You can do this as follows:

1. Open a command prompt and make travelsample/testdomain your
   current directory.

2. Enter "ant run" to start the domain manager.

3. In a browser, start the domain manager GUI by entering the URL
   "http://localhost:9990/ui/home". The recommended browser is Firefox
   because the domain manager GUI doesn't work with Internet Explorer.

4. In the browser window, create or update your domain manager
   configuration using the domain manager GUI.

5. To exit the domain manager, enter "q" in the command prompt window.
   The domain configuration is saved automatically and will be
   restored the next time you start the domain manager.

6. If you want to remove your saved configuration and start again from
   a clean slate, enter either "ant clean" or "mvn clean" from the
   command prompt window.


Running travel sample scenarios from the "binaries" directory
-------------------------------------------------------------

If the travel sample was built from the distribution using Ant or Maven,
a binary package for the travel sample will be created in the binaries/target
directory and its subdirectories. This binary package contains all the built
jar and war files and runtime dependencies for these files. By looking at the
contents of the binaries/target directory tree you can see how to package a
Yuscany application in binary form for distribution to users of the application.

The following subdirectories of binaries/target contain jar and war files
for the travel sample:
  clients - non-SCA clients using various communication technologies
  contributions - SCA contributions for the travel sample
  launchers - executable launchers for the travel sample
  services - non-SCA services using various communication technologies
  util - jar files needed by other jars in the travel sample
  webapps - war files for the travel sample

The following subdirectories of binaries/target contain runtime dependencies
for the above files:
  domainconfig - domain configuration files
  jaxws - JAX-WS runtime jars neeed when running the travel sample on JDK 5
  lib - Tuscany runtime jars and their dependencies needed by the travel sample
     (only present if the travel sample was built using "mvn -Pselfcontained")
  ode - JPA Derby database needed by the ODE runtime
  openejb - OpenEJB 3.1.2 runtime jars needed by the travel sample

To use the binary package to run the travel sample scenarios packaged with
launchers, you can do the following:
 1. Open a command prompt. 
 2. Change directory to travelsample/binaries/target/<runtime-dir> where
    <runtime-dir> is the directory for the scenario shown in Table 3 below.
 3. Enter the command for the scenario shown in Table 3. This runs an
    ant script that sets the necessary classpath and invokes the launcher class.
 4. Some scenarios require the above steps to be repeated multiple times
    with different commands. These cases are indicated by entries in
    Table 3 with more than one directory and command listed. For these
    scenarios, all the listed commands should be entered in separate command
    prompts from the listed current directories in the same order as shown.
 5. Some scenarios have a browser-based user interface which is started
    by entering the URL shown in Table 3 in a browser after running the
    launcher or launchers for the scenario. The recommended browser is
    Firefox as some scenarios don't work with Internet Explorer.

Some scenarios are packaged as web applications and don't have launchers.
You can run these using .war files from the binaries/target/webapps
directory as follows:
 1. Deploy the web application (.war) file to a Web application server
    such as Tomcat. The .war file can be found in the directory
    travelsample/binaries/target/webapps and has the name listed in
    Table 4 below.
 2. Display the browser-based user interface for the scenario by entering
    its URLs in a browser. The URLs for each scenario are shown in Table 4.
    The host and port in these URLs may need to be changed depending on the
    configuration of the Web application server in which the web application
    is deployed. These scenarios work in both Firefox and Internet Explorer.

Building and running the self-contained travel sample
-----------------------------------------------------

The travel sample can be built using the "mvn -Pselfcontained" command. This
puts all of its runtime dependencies under the binaries/target directory and
doesn't use any files from the Tuscany SCA Java binary distribution.

If the travel sample has been built in this way, you can run it as described
in the previous section using the same ant scripts. Alternatively you can
use the "java -jar" command to run the travel sample executable jars directly
using the manifest dependencies in the jar files. For example, the commands
  ant run-currency-converter-ws
  ant run-currency-converter-ws-jaxws
  ant run-smsgateway-corba
could be replaced by the commands
  java -jar scatours-launcher-currency-converter-ws.jar
  java -jar scatours-client-currency-converter-ws-jaxws.jar
  java -jar scatours-service-smsgateway-corba.jar
