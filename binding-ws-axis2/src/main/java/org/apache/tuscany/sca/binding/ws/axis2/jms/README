The classes in this package are a copy of the same classes from the 
Axis2 package org.apache.axis2.transport.jms in the Axis2 1.4.1 release.

The only change is in the listenOnDestination method in JMSConnectionFactory
to use Tuscany threads instead of the setMessageListener call approach when
running in a JEE container where setMessageListener is prohibited. There are
several classes copied in this Tuscany package as many of the constructors
and methods are not public so we can't just subclass to fix the problem.

In Axis2 1.5 and the new separately released JMS transport will fix this
problem so when we move up to that in Tuscany we can get rid of this package.
